# Heart-Rate-variability-analysis-using-MATLAB
This project analyzes an ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal to extract critical features such as R-peaks, heart rate variability (HRV) metrics, rhythm disturbances, and frequency-domain characteristics using MATLAB.

# Objective
The aim is to process raw ECG data to:

Remove noise and artifacts,

Detect R-peaks,

Calculate HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN),

Analyze rhythm disturbances,

Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD),

Visualize normalized ECG signals.

# Methodology
1. Data Acquisition
ECG signal is read from 100.dat using fread.

Sampling frequency: 360 Hz.

2. Preprocessing
Low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high-frequency noise.

High-pass Butterworth filter to eliminate low-frequency drift.

3. R-Peak Detection
Uses findpeaks() to locate R-waves.

From R-peak intervals, NN intervals are calculated.

4. HRV Metrics
RMSSD: Measures short-term variation (parasympathetic activity).

SDNN: Reflects overall HRV (sympathetic + parasympathetic).

5. Heart Rate Analysis
Heart rate (BPM) is calculated from average NN interval.

Visualized as a time series.

6. Rhythm Disturbance Detection
Compares RMSSD and SDNN against healthy thresholds.

Alerts if disturbance is suspected.

7. Frequency Domain Analysis
Uses Welchâ€™s method to plot PSD.

Highlights frequency components of the ECG signal.

8. Normalization
ECG signal is normalized to the range [-1, 1] for standardization.

# Sample Results
Heart Rate: ~50 BPM

RMSSD: 9.3

SDNN: 7

Rhythm Status: Rhythm disturbance detected (below healthy range)
